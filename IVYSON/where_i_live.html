    <h1>A Page That Is Not Coherent</h1>

    <p>As stated in my introduction, I'm a great Tech enthusiast who is always passionate about learning MORE to expand my horizon in the Tech world.<br>Right now I'm on an assignment to create and publish my first site By Bill mead of UC Davies who is my Tutor on Coursera. He asked that this page to be about where I live, but I couldn't step out to get the image of my house so I just have to do this painstaking Job of Joggling my mind to see how creative I can be with words, and it turns out that I'm a bit rusty and need some greasing.. Anyways blow  is the most Aesthetic image in my phone gallery. </p>

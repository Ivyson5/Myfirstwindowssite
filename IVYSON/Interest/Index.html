    <Button><h1><b>IvySon Personal Site: My General Interest</b></h1></Button>

    <p>This is suppose to be a page describing my general interest, but funny and embarrassing enough, I don't have a lot of knowledge about that yet and might have forgotten the exact name for my general Interest but let me paint a picture of it for you with this description in the next paragraph.</p>

    <p>Living in a dynamic world and an era of technological advancement, I'm always fascinated at the site of programmed machines improving the health care system and making the practice of medicine much more easier and Better, giving humans more time to study the complex human body.</p>

    <p>Generally my interest is where Tech meets medicine, I want to be an active pusher and a point-man who advocate for the full integration of tech into medicine, I want to be right at the node of intersection of where tech and medicine meets. I hope the research more.</p>

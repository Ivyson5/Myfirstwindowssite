   <p>One task of my assignment is to create an individual page for three of my interest and hobbies, but sorry, I'm largely an introvert who has little or no interest in many things of the word, don't get me wrong when I say things of the world I actually mean things that involve large crowds. I've a great interest in cubing {Cubic} but it's been long since I had a cube.</p>

    <p>You might be wondering how I couldn't even say a sport which I engage in, I once play football which I suck at lol!, not until the unfortunate incident of me fracturing my thigh bone {femur} when I was still very young, which had me bed ridden for 2-4 months and took me another 2 months until I could work properly on my two feet again.. I wouldn't say I'm totally healed now as I seldom experience some pains on the veins of my thigh. But I swear my leg isn't a hindrance to me not engaging in any sport activity as I can run a 32km in less than 15 minutes with same leg, I have ran that severally when I was prepping for NDA{Nigerian defense academy}. I don't engage in sports activities generally  because I fear that I'd be a mediocre at it which I know it's not a good fear.</p>
    
    <p>I do have a little interest in chess, but I don't play it consistently so I don't know if that count also as interest lol! So I hope the epistle explains clearly the above pictures.</p>

    <h1><b>A Few Poems by Ogden Nash</b></h1>

       <h2><b>The Panther</b></h2>

        <p>The panther is like leopard, <br>Except it hasn't been prepared. <br>Should you approach a Panther crouch, <br>Prepare to say Ouch. <br>Better yet, if called by a panther, <br>Don't anther</p>

        <h2><b>Lines on Facing Forty</b></h2>
        <p>I have a bone to pick with fate, <br> Come here and tell me girly, <br>Do you think my mind is approaching late, <br>Or simply rotting early.</p>

        <h2><b>The Lama</b></h2>

        <p>The one_l lama, <br>He's a priest. <br>The two_ll llama, <br>He's a beast. <br>And I will bet <br>A silk pajama <br> There isn't any left <br>Three_l lllama.</p>
